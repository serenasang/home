			<h1 class="history">Slavery</h1>
			<h2>
				Black incarceration began with the Atlantic Slave Trade. Starting in the 16th century, European slave traders kidnapped millions of african american men and forced them onto ships heading to the New World. Conditions on these ships were horrendous. Black people were chained together in close vicinity. This caused the rapid spread of diseases like smallpox and syphilis. They suffered through public whipping, branding, or rape during their journey as well.

			<h1 class="history">Convict Leasing: New Form of Slavery</h1>
			<h2>
				During the aftermath of the Civil War, southern states managed to create a system in which they could essentially rent out war prisoners to work on private railways, mines, or plantations. Prisoners earned no pay and were subject to cruel, inhumane working conditions. This system continued to operate until the 1930’s. Although the 13th Amendment was ratified shortly after the Civil War, it contained loopholes that many exploited, such as the exception of black criminals from the amendment. Many southern states passed “Black Codes” to further restrict black rights.

			<h1 class="history">Jim Crow Laws</h1>
			<h2>
				Because of the heavy discrimination integrated into the American society, black people were denied the opportunity to vote, hold jobs, receive an education or a degree, and more. Those who resisted against Jim Crow laws (a series of laws that “legally” segregated white and black people) faced arrests, fines, jail sentences, violence, and even death. Some other forms of segregation include different waiting rooms, elevators, cemeteries, water fountains, ticket windows, etc. Justice and legal systems discriminated against black people due to the fact that the majority of judge and police positions were held by people who stuck to confederate beliefs. A black offender would receive longer and harsher sentences than their white equal. Black prisoners often did not live out their entire sentence because of the brutal and grueling work that was set upon them. These laws ended in 1968, but it didn’t stop there.

			<h1 class="history">Mass Incarceration</h1>
			<h2>
				Even after the Jim Crow age, black rights are still denied, and racism is still predominant in incarceration and in politics today. Currently, the United States has not only the highest incarceration rate, but highest prison population rate in the world. According to a 2016 study, 39% of those incarcerated had no public safety reason backing their incarceration. This blatantly racist system has existed, and has continued to exist for centuries. Even after the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960’s politicians from both parties used fear and thinly veiled racial rhetoric to pass racist policies. Former President Nixon fueled this trend, declaring a “war on drugs” and justifying it with speeches about being “tough on crime.” President Reagan only continued this injustice in 1980. His two terms in office caused the prison rate to double, from 329,000 to 627,000. The rise in prison rates hit coloured communities the hardest -- this disproportionate rate still affects these communities today.  Today police officers are given incentives to incarcerate people, which causes an increase in prison rates. This too, affects coloured communities the hardest. Coloured neighborhoods, especially black communities are overpoliced, explaining the disproportionate amount of coloured people incarcerated today. Although you can argue that we have improved tremendously in terms of racism in politics and government, there is still room for improvement. The world is still unjust and we must work to fix it.

			<h1 class="history">Starlight Tours</h1>
			<h2>
				The starlight tours were a series of injustices upon indigenous peoples. During the winter, Saskatchewan police would arrest Indigenous people and drive them miles away from the city, only to leave them stranded miles from civilization. These incidents dated back as early as 1976. Another incident in 1990 happened to a Saulteaux First Nations teenager who was left alone in temperatures below −28 °C. Eventually, he died of hypothermia. In 2000, two bodies, subject to the same fate, were found on the outskirts of Saskatoon. Their names were Rodney Naistus and Lawrence Wegner. In attempts to cover-up these incidents, Saskatoon Police tried removing starlight tours from Wikipedia. A university student researching police brutality eventually discovered the Police were hiding their crimes and brought the incidents to light. There hasn't been any recent reported cases, but there is also no evidence that police have stopped.

			<h1 class="history">Police Brutality</h1>
			<h2>
				In addition to higher policing in coloured neighborhoods, minorities are more likely to be victims of police brutality. In response to the current Black lives Matter Movement, many victims are sharing their experiences through video recordings. In Canada especially, injustice towards indigineous people are at a high. On March 10th, Indigenous Chief Allan Adam was assaulted by a police officer and arrested simply because his license plate had expired. Wood Buffalo RCMP – the same organization that was originally created with the intent to move indigenous peoples into residential schools – claimed that they were “required to use force” because Chief Adam was resisting arrest. Similarly, Chantel Moore, an indigenous woman, was shot and killed by Edmundston Police during a wellness check. The current policing system clearly does not teach officers how to de-escalate situations, a skill desperately needed for those carrying deadly weapons.
