			<h2>13th</h2>
			<h3>
				Media: Netflix<br>
				This documentary dives into racial inequality and criminalization in the United States of America. While this documentary is quite lengthy, it's worth watching every second of it.
			</h3>
			<blockquote>
				"People say all the time, ‘well, I don’t understand how people could have tolerated slavery?’ ‘How could they have made peace with that?’ ‘How could people have gone to a lynching and participated in that?’ ‘That’s so crazy, if I was living at that time I would never have tolerated anything like that.’ And the truth is we are living in this time, and we are tolerating it.” - Bryan Stevenson

			<h2>The Hate U Give</h2>
			<h3>
				Media: Youtube / Book<br>
				This book/movie focuses on an ordinary girl, Amandla Stenberg, who struggles with two "separate" lives and police brutality. It's an amazing starter book/movie for younger people to educate themselves on.
			</h3>
			<blockquote>
				“That's the problem. We let people say stuff, and they say it so much that it becomes okay to them and normal for us. What's the point of having a voice if you're gonna be silent in those moments you shouldn't be?” - Angie Thomas

			<h2>Between the World and Me</h2>
			<h3>
				Media: Book<br>
				This book is written as a letter to the author's teenage son about racism.
			</h3>
			<blockquote>
				“But race is the child of racism, not the father. And the process of naming “the people” has never been a matter of genealogy and physiognomy so much as one of hierarchy. Difference in hue and hair is old. But the belief in the preeminence of hue and hair, the notion that these factors can correctly organize a society and that they signify deeper attributes, which are indelible—this is the new idea at the heart of these new people who have been brought up hopelessly, tragically, deceitfully, to believe that they are white.” - Ta-Nehisi Coates

			<h2>White Rage: The Unspoken Truth of Our Racial Divide</h2>
			<h3>
				Media: Book<br>
				This book talks about white backlash in America. The response to <a href= "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/ferguson-wasnt-black-rage-against-copsit-was-white-rage-against-progress/2014/08/29/3055e3f4-2d75-11e4-bb9b-997ae96fad33_story.html" target="_blank"> this </a> article inspired her to write this book.
			</h3>
			<blockquote>
				“White rage is not about visible violence, but rather it works its way through the courts, the legislatures, and a range of government bureaucracies. It wreaks havoc subtly, almost imperceptibly. Too imperceptibly, certainly, for a nation consistently drawn to the spectacular—to what it can see. It’s not the Klan. White rage doesn’t have to wear sheets, burn crosses, or take to the streets. Working the halls of power, it can achieve its ends far more effectively, far more destructively.” - Carol Anderson

			<h2>Tears We Cannot Stop</h2>
			<h3>
				Media: Book<br>
				This book talks about how if we want real racial progress, we have to face the truth of what marginalized communities go through.
			</h3>
			<blockquote>
				“When black folk say “Black Lives Matter,” they are in search of simple recognition. That they are decent human beings, that they aren’t likely to commit crimes, that they’re reasonably smart. That they’re no more evil than the next person, that they’re willing to work hard to get ahead, that they love their kids and want them to do better than they did. That they are loving and kind and compassionate. And that they should be treated with the same respect that the average, nondescript, unexceptional white male routinely receives without fanfare or the expectation of” - Michael Eric Dyson
