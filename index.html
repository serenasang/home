		<h1>Issues in America and Canada</h1>
		<!-- Designs the text -->
		<div class = "text_box">
			<p>It is no lie that our society has advanced tremendously. In the year 2020, the majority of us have access to tools like self-driving cars, and working cable. Both are items and tools that we consider helpful and advanced. Our ideologies as a society, however, drag far behind our technological advancements. Ideas like racism, xenophobia, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia are still widely prevalent throughout the globe. 2020 should not be a year in which we achieve no change, no bettering of our society. In the year 2020, the KKK, a white supremacy group should not be able to roam free, yet they do. Highly offensive racial slurs are casually thrown into everyday conversation, Indigenous peoples are still being treated the same way they were three centuries ago, homosexual teenagers are still thrown out of their own homes, and young women are still terrified of being out alone at night. As a society, we have not made nearly as much progress as we should have. This NEEDS to change. Yet in order to achieve this, we must take a stand for what’s right. We must educate ourselves -- learn about the hard truths and work to change them. Luckily, as a society, we are not yet completely lost. The start of this great change is happening right now, starting with the Black Lives Matter movement.

		<h1>What is BLM?</h1>
		<!-- Designs the text -->
		<div class = "text_box">
			<h2>BLM stands for "Black Lives Matter".</h2>
			<p>
				Started by three black women in 2013, the movement was created in response to the murder of Trayvon Martin, an innocent black teenager. The movement trended, using the hashtag “#BlackLivesMatter”. Through social media, people around the Americas shared their stories about police brutality and racism, sparking outrage, and a growing need for justice. The movement’s momentum dwindled for a few years but returned with more support than ever following the death of George Floyd.

				In conjunction with the Black Lives Matter movement, the term ACAB spread throughout social media. “All Cops Are Bastards” (commonly misunderstood as “All Cops are Bad”) is the idea that the current policing system is corrupt. The word "bastard" comes from the word "bastarize". It allows cops to take advantage of the power they were given and allows cops the ability to harm the innocent with merely a slap on the wrist as punishment. The policing system was intended to protect citizens, to protect justice. Yet the exact opposite is true, especially in marginalized groups. The term ACAB is not used to demean every individual police officer, it is used to demean the corrupt and unjust system.Good cops would either leave the system or are forced to resign. One example is Stephen Mader. He was fired because he didn't shoot and murder a Black man, RJ Williams, in a standoff. The chief of Weirton Police Department, Rob Alexander, didn't fire the person who shot Williams. Mader's lawsuit against Weirton Police Department stated, "The Weirton Police Department terminated Mr. Mader’s employment because he chose not to use deadly force to shoot and kill an African-American man who was suicidal."
