				In order to incite this change against racism and injustice, we must do all that we can to support this movement. We need to utilize our right to protest, for that is the only way we can inspire change and reform. According to a joint study done by Harvard and Stockholm University, protests have a major influence on politics. Not only do big crowds send a signal to policy-makers, but they inspire others to become politically active. Bigger turnouts to rallies and protests have a direct effect on the amount of people who vote, as well as the party they vote. What is posted on media or broadcasted on the news has a profound effect on many people’s opinions, even subconsciously. The energy surrounding protests and movements like this one is what galvanizes people to vote for politicians that share the same views, and support these protests.

				Years of protests is what caused politicians to pass laws allowing homosexual marriages, as well as laws protecting homosexual rights. The Stonewall riots, which were originally riots against police brutality, had a significant impact on homosexual rights -- these riots eventually evolved into the first Pride: A rally still celebrated today.

				Protests are what lead to women’s suffrage as well. It was only after decades of protests and fighting that women were able to gain voting rights in both the United States and Canada. Canadian suffragists relied on peaceful protests to convince government officials. It took women in Canada an upwards of seventy years to gain full voting rights, yet they still continued to relentlessly protest in order to fight or what's just. Although the change brought about by suffragist rallies and protests were a slow burn, they were still able to reform the government in order to better serve justice for all.

				Today, our goal is to incite a great change through these protests, petitions and rallies. Although it may take some time to establish fully just laws and systems, we must first be willing to take that first step, to incite the first push that sets everything into motion. We have already begun reform because of these rallies and protests. Due to the strong support for the Black Lives matter movement, public opinion has shifted dramatically regarding black rights and police brutality. Every day, more and more cases are being reopened and investigated in order to bring to light tragic police brutality examples and to finally bring justice to those victims.

				As a result of these protests, the Minneapolis Police Department disbanded and is currently in the process of being rebuilt and reformed. Confederate statues are being removed, and more cities are starting to invest money into improving communities of colour. For example, Los Angeles reinvested over 100 million from the LAPD budget into communities of colour in order to improve infrastructure, education, and job access. These protests are even shifting support against the current republican party. Approval rates for President Trump dropped a whopping 15% following protests.
